                    This is a multi-threaded IRC chat application implemented in Python. Two implementations are available: <br/>
                    - multi server <br/>
                    - single server <br/>
                    For each implementation there is a client-side code that allows users to connect to the server, 
                    join channels, and send messages and there is a server-side code capable of handling multiple clients and servers.
                    <br/> Each server logs relevant information (precious for debugging).

                    This project is an implementation of Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway. 
                    The game is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. 
                    The project was coded in OCaml and Python.
                    Both version are very different and have different features.

                    This project is a simple notes app for Android. It was created to learn Kotlin and how to create an Android app.
                    We decided to try to only use chatgpt to generate the code as a challenge. In the end we stil had to write some code (~15%) but it was a fun experience.
                    As a result of this experience we can say that chatgpt is not yet ready to replace human developpers. 
                    The ~15% of code we had to write was mostly to fix the code generated by chatgpt, which was not always correct. 
                    The big problem was that chatgpt was not able to understand the context of the code.
